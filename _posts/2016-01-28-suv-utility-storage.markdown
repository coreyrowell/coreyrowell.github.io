The real motivation behind this was to create a place to eventually store all my computer systems and electrical for my autonomous car project.

Not pictured: the 4x8 sheet of plywood I started with. But here it is cut to fit in the back of my Blazer.

Looking to the front:

Looking out the back:

Gap I left between the tailgate.

Cover still fits (and I remembered another potential spot to hide electrical).

Test fit! Also not pictured: the 2x4x8 board I ripped down to size as well.

Got some spray glue.

Wrapping the boards with outdoor carpet.

This was easier and went a lot quicker than I expected.

Layout I went for that gives me 4 storage areas. Where the paper weight is sitting will be hidden by the rear seats in their upright position. At ~8" deep, I plan to use the space vertically as well.

Test fitting the base.

Left side storage area:

Right side storage area:

![3-15]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3-15.jpg)

All pieces in place:

![3-16]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3-16.jpg)

From the rear, facing forward

![3-17]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3-17.jpg)

From the cab, facing rear (this is where most of my electronics will go).

![3-18]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3-18.jpg)

Cover still fits!

![3-19]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3-19.jpg)

Everything sits flush with the plastic moulding.
