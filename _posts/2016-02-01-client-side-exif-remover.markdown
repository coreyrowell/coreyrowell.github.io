Client side EXIF data remover: [http://ec2-52-88-126-197.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/exif/](http://ec2-52-88-126-197.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/exif/)

I wrote this web tool to strip exif data from images in bulk. I didn't want to download a 3rd party tool, the online tools only accepted a single image, and who knows what they do with that data.

This runs entirely client side!
